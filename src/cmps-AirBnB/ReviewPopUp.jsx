Nihat was perfect host, quite welcoming and helpful about places to go (or avoid) and things to do in town. HosÃ§a kal!'}/>

The location was perfect and Nihat welcomed us even when we made a late reservation and arrived early. He works at a bar no far from there- a great place to have a drink after seeing the sites! I highly recommend this place!'}/>

The bedroom is quiet at night, even though there is a crowded area next to the flat. Nihat was always extremely quick in answering our emails and let us feel comfortable. He is really kind and discrete, we met him few times cause he works in the evening.'}/>
